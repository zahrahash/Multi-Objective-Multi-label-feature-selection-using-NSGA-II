# Multi-objective Multi-label Feature Selection using the NSGA-II algorithm

In the field of machine learning, feature selection stands as a pivotal pre-processing step, aimed at enhancing model performance by eliminating redundant or irrelevant features. This project focuses on using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for multi-objective feature selection in multi-label classification tasks. The main objectives of this approach are to minimize the hamming loss and the number of features used.



## NSGA-II algorithm

The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is an evolutionary algorithm designed for solving multi-objective optimization problems. It works by evolving a population of 
candidate solutions over several generations. NSGA-II uses a fast non-dominated sorting 
approach to classify solutions into different fronts based on their level of dominance. It also 
applies a crowding distance mechanism to maintain diversity among solutions. The algorithm 
selects, crosses, and mutates solutions to explore the search space, aiming to find a set of optimal solutions that represent the best trade-offs among the objectives.
